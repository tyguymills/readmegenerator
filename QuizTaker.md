# Description
Creates a fun quiz for users to take and play. Users score will be taken with each question correct and a timer will be ticking down and once it hits zero the game will end. Users who score points will be able to insert their score into the scoreboard and will be ranked based on points. There is also a clear scoreboard button to clear out an extensive scoreboard section. The userboard will collect initials of the users like an old arcade game.
