# Description
Make an website that allows the user to use the blogging feature only if they are signed in. Able to Store the users comments and edit them at any time.
    
# Usage
to learn more about handlebars and how to enable access by signing into the login.
    
# Installation
must use `npm install`, as well as connect to a mysqlworkbench. you need to seed the data properly using `node seeds/index.js`. Next you must create a .env file to contain your DB_NAME, DB_USER, AND DB_PASSWORD. If you did everything properly, then using node server.js should start up the server where you can use insomnia or the browser and type in http://localhost(Port). I used 3002 but it's up to you.
