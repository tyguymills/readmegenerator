# Description
Made a code using express to create a document where you can make your very own notes list that features a save, delete, new note button, and more and uses server commands as well as an ejs document.
    
# Usage
The purpose was to get to understand express as well as server vs client side coding using javascript and learn how they communicate to build the notetaker assignment.
    
# Installation
install npm init, express, and nodemon packages and make sure to require them.
